### From Releases
Look for the latest release, and download ``OculusReportMenu.dll``. Drag this into your plugins folder.

## Why?
Every major mod menu that Gorilla Tag modders use include an "anti-report" that will remove them from the lobby the moment it detects a user pressing the report button over their name. The Oculus report menu bypasses this by placing a leaderboard in front of you so you can report them without their anti-report kicking in.

This has never been avaliable to PCVR users, and it is super easy to implement in a small mod. This mod provides the same functionality and is completely legal and cannot get you banned.

## Usage
Press your secondary button on the left controller to open the menu. Close it with the "X" button at the top of the screen.

# Headsets
For any headset that does not have a secondary left button, you can use the Alt key to open the menu on your keyboard.
